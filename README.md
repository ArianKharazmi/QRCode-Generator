# QRCode-Generator-and-Reverse-Search (v2.0)
A tool to create simple, customizable QRCode images. You can add any text entry or URL you wish and it will work. You can customize the entry, size, colors, and the name of the QR Code you wish to generate. All you need is your phone or other QRCode Scanner and your Python IDE.

The QRCode program is being updated to include automated Reverse QRCode search via your webcam for the next major release. 

Soon you will not only be able to create and customize your own generated QRCodes, but also use the same program to allow for automated reverse searches of QRCodes you present to your webcam through the program.

**Work in Progress**
